# commit-js

Originally created for the purpose of displaying commits from the Sticky Paws project on its website, this HTML/JavaScript widget has been generalized to support any given list of GitHub repositories.

It serves as a flexible utility for showcasing the recent updates and changes across different projects. The widget fetches commit data from the input list of GitHub repositories and presents them in an easy-to-read layout. Through simple adjustments, the tool can be adapted to display commits from any set of GitHub repositories.
